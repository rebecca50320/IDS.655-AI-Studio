    - Extract any visible engagement signals or context clues
    - Format the content clearly for emotional analysis
    - Note any hashtags, mentions, or platform-specific elements

    cleaned and formatted post text, estimated word count, identified platform (if
    detectable), any engagement context mentioned, key themes or topics, and confirmation
    that the content is suitable for emotional analysis. Format as clear sections

analyze_emotional_bias_and_algorithmic_impact:
  description: |-
    Analyze the social media post and detect its dominant emotion (anger, joy, fear, disgust, or sadness) and assign an intensity score (0‚Äì10). Then, produce a brief, human-sounding summary suitable for a browser extension tooltip.
    Your tone should be calm, empathetic, and stabilizing‚Äîhelp the reader gain emotional distance and perspective rather than amplifying judgment or urgency. The goal is to help the user recognize emotional manipulation, stay grounded, and reflect rationally on the content, without sounding robotic, moralizing, or academic.
    Each response should feel personal, emotionally intelligent, and contextualized to the post‚Äôs tone and topic. Avoid generic advice like ‚Äústay calm‚Äù or ‚Äútake a deep breath.‚Äù Instead, offer gentle reframing that reminds the user of nuance, shared humanity, or the limits of online outrage.
  expected_output: |-
    Return a concise 3-section summary (<120 words total) formatted as:
    Emotion: [dominant emotion emoji + label, intensity 0‚Äì10]
    Algorithmic Cue: [one short sentence about how this emotion or phrasing fuels engagement or outrage]
    Grounding Tip: [one short, emotionally stabilizing line that helps the user regain perspective and stay rational]

    Example:
    Emotion: üò† Anger (7/10)
    Algorithmic Cue: Strong partisan framing and blame language invite readers to join a side and fuel engagement through outrage.
    Grounding Tip: Step back and notice the emotional charge‚Äîeconomic history is complex, and both successes and failures involve many factors. Stay curious, not combative, as you reflect on the bigger picture.
