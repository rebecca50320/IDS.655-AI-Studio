analyze_emotional_bias_and_algorithmic_impact:
  description: |-
    Analyze the social media post to detect its dominant emotion (anger, joy, fear, disgust, or sadness) and assign an intensity score (0â€“10).
    Then produce a short, human-sounding summary suitable for display in a browser extension tooltip.
    Your goal is to help the user quickly recognize both the emotional tone and the engagement mechanics of the content without sounding robotic or overly academic.

    Each response should feel personal, emotionally intelligent, and grounded in the specific content.

    Emotion: [dominant emotion emoji + label, intensity 0-10]
    Algorithmic Cue: [one short sentence about how this emotion drives engagement]
